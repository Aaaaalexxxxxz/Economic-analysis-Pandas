# 🧮 U.S. Economic Analysis — Unemployment and Labor Participation

This project performs a data-driven economic analysis of labor market indicators across U.S. states using the **FRED API** (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and **pandas** for data wrangling and visualization.  

The main focus is on understanding and comparing **Unemployment Rates** and **Labor Force Participation Rates** between 2020–2022 (or other periods) for each U.S. state.
